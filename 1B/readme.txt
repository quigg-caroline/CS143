We started off part 1B by reading the Introduction to MySQL and making sure both partners had a grasp on the syntax. Then together we worked on creating and loading the tables, and making sure there was no issues setting that up. Once we got a couple working tables, Caroline finished typing up the rest of the create and load files. Natasha inserted the tuples for the MaxPersonID and MaxMovieID tables. Once our tables were loaded, we worked on the queries together as well by paired programming. Caroline set up the php file and html table. Together, we thought of constraints and wrote violations for those constraints. Natasha wrote up the team.txt and readme.
